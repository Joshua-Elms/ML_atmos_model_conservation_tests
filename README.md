This contains tests of machine learning (ML) atmosphere model conservation properties. The current tests are:
1. Conservation of Mass - is the model able to accurately represent the constancy of global area-weighted surface pressure?
2. Radiative Balance - is the model able to maintain a budget between the incoming solar radiation (ISR), outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and atmospheric total energy ($E_T$) for short timescales?

We consider two types of models: weather models and climate models. The weather models include FCN, SFNO (two versions thereof), FCN3, FuXi (decomposed into component models), Pangu (decomposed), and GraphCastOperational. The climate models include ACE2 and Camulator. We expect the climate models, which are explicitly formulated to be conservative of quantities such as moisture and mass, to perform better on these tests than the weather models, which are exclusively optimized for forecast skill. We include the weather models both for general completeness (conservation remains untested in most of them) and to understand whether their respective architectures and training methodologies lead to more or less "inherent" conservation skill.
